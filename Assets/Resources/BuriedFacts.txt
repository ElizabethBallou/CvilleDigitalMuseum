As late as 1720, the land around Charlottesville belonged to the Monacan tribe of Native Americans. The Monacans lived in a village, Monasukapanough, on the nearby Rivanna River.
The Monacans were pushed from their land by men like Peter Jefferson, Thomas Jefferson's father, who arrived in Albemarle County in 1736.
Until the Civil War, enslaved people made up the majority of Charlottesville's population. Thomas Jefferson himself owned 607 people.
Thomas Jefferson fathered children with an enslaved woman, Sally Hemings, starting when she was 16 and he was 46. As his slave, Hemings could not reject Jefferson's sexual advances.
In the 1800s and 1900s, the University of Virginia employed many academics who believed in scientific racism, including Ivey Lewis, Paul Brandon Barringer, and Robert Bean.
The first Jewish professor at UVA, James Joseph Sylvester, left after half a year due to rampant anti-Semitism. UVA had a quota for Jewish students until the early 1900s.
UVA didn't admit black students until 1950, when Gregory Swanson was admitted. He was initially rejected, but won a lawsuit against UVA and registered as a law student.
