    = amplifying_footnotes
    #Jalane
    We give this tour usually on a monthly basis. I sometimes do it with student groups and journalist groups that come through as well. We do this as an effort to promote public history. I call this an exercise of amplifying footnotes.

    #Jalane
    You have to literally look down in order to see this.

    %So intentionality matters. Could we argue with the intentionality of wanting to mark a spot? But the real fact of it is, we look past it. Many of you did not even know it was here.
    
    = memory_not_history
    #Jalane
    %Memory is not the same thing as history. Memory can be promoted, tweaked, produced, reproduced by things such as statues, or books, or activites, pop culture programming, all this sort of thing.
    
    = produce_horses_humans
    #Jalane
    The reason for the sales here was that on court days, when people would be filing papers - legal notices, bills of sale, et cetera - there would be markets set up here. Sometimes enslaved folks who had their own garden plots, if they had a bit more produce they could bring it into town and sell it. Also free blacks as well.
    
    %So produce, horses, and humans are what would have been sold here on those court days.
    
    = slave_auction_block
    #Jalane
    This is the slave auction block. There were actually several sites around Court Square where enslaved people were sold. This has been the one that the city has opted to mark.
    
    %As you can see, it's about one foot by one foot, flush with the sidewalk here. Bronze lettering. It says, "Slave auction block. On this site, slaves were bought and sold." And every once in a while, someone comes by here and covers up the "slaves" part and puts the word "humans."
    
    %Over half the community here was enslaved. But this is it. This is what we got.
    
    = taxpayer_cost
    #Andrea
    In terms of thinking about the monetization of Confederate objects and histories and things, we're spending almost $40 million  a year on these things. Meaning the museums, meaning the care of parks, meaning the houses. All those kinds of things have a taxpayer monetization -
    
    #Jalane
    %You, you, you, you, you! You are paying for this! $800,000 in the Commonwealth of Virginia alone.
