JS_AD_introduction	JS| 0 | This is Dr. Andrea Douglas, who's executive director of the Jefferson School African American Heritage Center.	AD| 5 | Yes.	JS| 6| And I am an associate professor of religious studies at the University of Virginia. I'm Jalane Schmidt.
taxpayer_cost	AD| 0 | In terms of thinking about the monetization of Confederate objects and histories and things, we're spending almost $40 million a year on these things. Meaning the museums, meaning the care of parks, meaning the houses. All those kinds of things have a taxpayer monetization -	JS | 4 | You, you, you, you, you! You are paying for this! $800,000 in the Commonwealth of Virginia alone.	
amplifying_footnotes	JS| 0 |We give this tour usually on a monthly basis. I sometimes do it with student groups and journalist groups that come through as well. We do this as an effort to promote public history. I call this an exercise of amplifying footnotes.		
an_act_of_god	JH|0| 1720, 1730, the ancestor of - Ambrose Madison, for example, that's James Madison's grandfather, and Peter Jefferson, who arrives and builds Shadwell - they start coming up in the 1720s, 1730s. And the European belief, not just the English but the European belief, was that if land was not fenced, it was open. What the English do is take land that has been recently cleared and they act as if it's an act of god.		
based_in_amherst_county	JH|0|The Monacan people today are based in Amherst county, but they know that their history extends up here. It's very hard, in a Native American landscape, to put a pin in the map and say, "This is where they lived." Because they moved about, in the sense of an agricultural people who, every ten or fifteen years, would have moved their main village.

today_we_established_control	JH|0|Peter Jefferson, as an example, never sat down and wrote in a journal, "Today we took over [Monacan] land." They never say that. But they say, "Today we established our control over Indian gardens, Indian run, Indian camp." It's a long list.		
we_dont_want_you_to_know_us 	JH|0|John Smith, in 1607 and 1608, he wrote a summary of Virginia Indians and he said, "Oh, those Monacans, they don't know how to plant, they won't give you food. They're a warlike people. They speak a language no one can understand." It was all nonsense. 	EB|17|Yeah, and it seems like these early narratives, written mostly by white colonists, kind of determined this disappearance of the Monacan people from written record.	JH|31|That's exactly right. The Monacan people said, "You don't know us at all, and we don't want you to know us."
we_give_our_thanks	JH|0|Whenever there is a major ceremony, whether it be graduation or convocation in the fall, the ceremony begins with the president of the university acknowledging that we are here on ancestral Monacan land, and we give our thanks. It sounds like it's a symbolic act, but it's hugely important in this state that has ignored Native American history for so long. Except Jamestown. The three years of Jamestown.
