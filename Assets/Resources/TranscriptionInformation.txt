amplifying_footnotes	JS| 0 |We give this tour usually on a monthly basis. I sometimes do it with student groups and journalist groups that come through as well. We do this as an effort to promote public history. I call this an exercise of amplifying footnotes.			
an_act_of_god	JH|0| 1720, 1730, the ancestor of - Ambrose Madison, for example, that's James Madison's grandfather, and Peter Jefferson, who arrives and builds Shadwell - they start coming up in the 1720s, 1730s. And the European belief, not just the English but the European belief, was that if land was not fenced, it was open. What the English do is take land that has been recently cleared and they act as if it's an act of god.			
based_in_amherst_county	JH|0|The Monacan people today are based in Amherst county, but they know that their history extends up here. It's very hard, in a Native American landscape, to put a pin in the map and say, "This is where they lived." Because they moved about, in the sense of an agricultural people who, every ten or fifteen years, would have moved their main village.			
city_beautiful 	JS|0|This was part of a downtown development boom that started happening at the beginning of the 20th century. These statues are part of that development, the so-called "City Beautiful" movement, which was interlaced with ideas about race.*Part of what was "beautiful" was who needed to be removed, supposedly, from public spaces in order to beautify them. At the beginning of the 20th century, this was actually a mixed-race area, downtown here.			
denying_education	PL|0|There was a real philosophy at the University, a real philosophy throughout much of the 20th century and of course the 19th century, of white supremacy. This was a university for the gentleman sons of the planter class.*In some ways, the mythology about the University wasn't just an idealistic mythology. It was actually the reality that was denying so many other people access to a state-supported education.			
glorification_old_white_men	PL|0|I felt, in the 1980s, that what I learned on the Guides Service tour was all about Jefferson and the great white men who were educated here.*I felt there was very little focus on how the University had evolved and what it had become. I thought that there was a kind of glorification of the old University.*So is this the kind of information you want? The whole thing?	EB|29.881|Yeah, definitely.	PL|31.16|All right.	
JH_introduction	JH|0|Jeffrey Hantman, professor emeritus of anthropology at the University of Virginia			
JS_AD_introduction	JS| 0 | This is Dr. Andrea Douglas, who's executive director of the Jefferson School African American Heritage Center.	AD| 5 | Yes.	JS| 6| And I am an associate professor of religious studies at the University of Virginia. I'm Jalane Schmidt.	
kept_careful_records	PL|0|There was a clear attitude, I would say, a social pressure that the University was not really interested in Jews.*The dean of students who was also, for a while, dean of the faculty named Ivey Lewis who very consciously kept records in which he says, "We need to be really careful about how many Jewish students we're accepting here. I'm keeping careful records."*His records distinguished between Virginians, non-Virginians, and Hebrews, was the term.			
many_of_you_did_not_know	JS|0|You have to literally look down in order to see this.	AD|4.5|So intentionality matters. Could we argue with the intentionality of wanting to mark a spot? But the real fact of it is, we look past it. Many of you did not even know it was here.		
memory_not_history	JS|0|Memory is not the same thing as history. Memory can be promoted, tweaked, produced, reproduced by things such as statues, or books, or activites, pop culture programming, all this sort of thing.			
paranoia_black_majority	JS|0|After the end of Reconstruction in 1877, the former Confederates that had been barred from office because of their participation, especially leadership cadre folks, start slipping back into government and trying to re-establish white supremacy.* And they use those words: "white supremacy." They were not embarrassed about it. It kind of rings in our ears today, but they were very sanguine.*That's the goal here, is to have the supremacy of the white race. White supremacy. And so they come back into office and things start getting really bad.*This paranoia of a black majority is very fixed in the white imaginary of this city.			
PL_introduction	PL|0|I am Phyllis Leffler. For most of my career at the University of Virginia, I taught and studied public history, which is the history of public spaces writ large.*In the course of that, while I was at UVA since 1986, I developed an interest in how the University tells the story of itself.			
PL_research_realization 	PL|0|Part of my focus actually became the history of women at UVA, and in the course of doing that work, I really came to understand about all the other groups that were denied access.*Of course, we know that African-American students didn't come to UVA until the first one was admitted in the 50s, but there was no substantial number of African-American students until the late 60s.*There were laws in Virginia that actually prohibited people of color from coming to the University as undergraduates if there was another program elsewhere that would admit them and taught the same subjects.	EB|35.5| And when you say "people of color," do you mean all people of color, or -	PL|41| It was predominantly African-Americans.	
produce_horses_humans	JS|0|The reason for the sales here was that on court days, when people would be filing papers - legal notices, bills of sale, et cetera - there would be markets set up here.*Sometimes enslaved folks who had their own garden plots, if they had a bit more produce they could bring it into town and sell it. Also free blacks as well.*So produce, horses, and humans are what would have been sold here on those court days.			
public_schools	JS|0|Public schools in the South really didn't exist before Reconstruction. That is a legacy of those Reconstruction governments specifically.	AD|7.84|There is a little bit of an article that says, and I'll paraphrase, "The Negros are free. They've found a little school. They're learning to read and write. They want to sit on our juries, they'll want to be in our parlors. And then they'll want to marry our daughters." So that's the concern of September, 1865.	JS|25.762|Of the white population locally.	AD|27.517|Freedom and Liberation Day is March 3rd, 1865. This article is September, 1865. It's one of the contiguous announcements of what the white population is thinking about what emancipation looks like.
reconstruction_1	JS|0|Reconstruction was that twelve-year period from 1865 to 1877, when Union troops withdrew, when there were biracial governments throughout the South.*Virginia was the first state to be readmitted to the Union, and the requirement was, write a state constitution that's up to snuff with the U.S. constitution.	AD|17.75|Virginia constitution is 1868. That's the constitution that allows Virginia back into the United States.	JS|24.5|Black male voters, after the 15th Amendment, were voting and becoming delegates in political parties, becoming delegates and senators in the legislature.	
slave_auction_block	JS|0|This is the slave auction block. There were actually several sites around Court Square where enslaved people were sold. This has been the one that the city has opted to mark.*As you can see, it's about one foot by one foot, flush with the sidewalk here. Bronze lettering. It says, "Slave auction block. On this site, slaves were bought and sold." And every once in a while, someone comes by here and covers up the "slaves" part and puts the word "humans."*Over half the community here was enslaved. But this is it. This is what we got.			
taxpayer_cost	AD| 0 | In terms of thinking about the monetization of Confederate objects and histories and things, we're spending almost $40 million a year on these things. Meaning the museums, meaning the care of parks, meaning the houses. All those kinds of things have a taxpayer monetization -	JS | 4 | You, you, you, you, you! You are paying for this! $800,000 in the Commonwealth of Virginia alone.		
today_we_established_control	JH|0|Peter Jefferson, as an example, never sat down and wrote in a journal, "Today we took over [Monacan] land." They never say that. But they say, "Today we established our control over Indian gardens, Indian run, Indian camp." It's a long list.			
we_dont_want_you_to_know_us 	JH|0|John Smith, in 1607 and 1608, he wrote a summary of Virginia Indians and he said, "Oh, those Monacans, they don't know how to plant, they won't give you food. They're a warlike people."*"They speak a language no one can understand." It was all nonsense. 	EB|17.994|Yeah, and it seems like these early narratives, written mostly by white colonists, kind of determined this disappearance of the Monacan people from written record.	JH|31.894|That's exactly right. The Monacan people said, "You don't know us at all, and we don't want you to know us."	
we_give_our_thanks	JH|0|Whenever there is a major ceremony, whether it be graduation or convocation in the fall, the ceremony begins with the president of the university acknowledging that we are here on ancestral Monacan land, and we give our thanks.*It sounds like it's a symbolic act, but it's hugely important in this state that has ignored Native American history for so long. Except Jamestown. The three years of Jamestown.
